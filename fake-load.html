  <h2>Any questions?</h2>
  <p>Shout them out as we go. That's more fun.</p>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>This is a talk about automatically running fake load every night against our production environment.</p>

  <h2>Who are JUST EAT?</h2>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>Started in DK 2001. UK 2005.  Now in ~15 countries.</p>
    <p>Online takeaway - online sales channel for restaurant partners</p>
    <p>We put their menus online; customers order through us, we forward orders to restaurants and charge a commission</p>
    <p>I joined in Jan 2010. First day spent figuring out how we did on busiest day of the year. 7 people in tech</p>
    <p>Now, 250 people in tech, 3 different tech hubs, AWS hosted, much higher scale.</p>
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Performance?</h2>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>Around 70 searches a second at head of conversion funnel</p>
    <p>Around 1000 orders a minute at conversion point</p>
    <p>Around 25k restaurant partners in the UK</p>
    <p>Several million customers in the UK</p>
    <p>By contrast, 6 years ago we fell over on busiest day of the year trying to cope with 2-3 orders per minute in one country.</p>
    <p>... for 3 years running</p>
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>When do you suppose peak time is?</h2>
  <div class="fragment">
    <p>The same time we DoS ourselves, of course!</p>
    <img src="fake-load/fake-vs-real-load.png" alt="fake vs real load"/>
  </div>

  <aside class="notes">
  <p>Chart is taken from 14 December. We're running around 1200 orders per minute extra on top of real load. Ish.</p>
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>We have cyclic demand</h2>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>Daily peak time 5-9pm</p>
    <p>Weekly peak time Fri/Sat</p>
    <p>Monthly peak is payday weekend</p>
    <p>Winter is busier than summer - rain makes people buy takeout</p>
    <p>Busiest day is Valentine's Day in the UK...</p>
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The problem with continuous delivery</h2>
  <p class="fragment">Everyone wants to change everything, <strong>all the time</strong>.</p>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>In 2010, we did maybe 30 deployments</p>
    <p>In 2014, we did more than 800</p>
    <p>We stopped really counting that in 2015</p>
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Traditional approach</h2>
  <blockquote>Let's make an environment like production and run load through that.</blockquote>
  <aside class="notes">
    <ul>
      <li>No-one owns it, so it's out of date</li>
      <li>Everyone wants it, so it's never available</li>
      <li>Duplicating production costs too much, so it's never the same</li>
      <li>Cost is an issue - this environment isn't in use all the time, but the hardware is bought.</li>
    </ul>
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Individual tests take too long</h2>

  <aside class="notes">
    <ul>
      <li>Soak for an hour at least</li>
      <li>Stress tests</li>
      <li>Boring boring boring</li>
      <li>Context switches when failure happens in first 5m of 60m test</li>
    </ul>
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>But of course...</h2>

  <aside class="notes">
    <ul>
      <li>Don't slow down - don't block people from releasing</li>
      <li>Don't break it - no embarrassing performance regressions</li>
    </ul>
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>So, test all the time</h2>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>Continuously run some load through</p>
    <p>Leverage monitoring+alerting to prevent getting worse</p>
    <p>...but this doesn't solve <q>works in my environment</q> because your environment isn't production</p>
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>So, test in production</h2>

  <div class="fragment">
    <blockquote>We deploy 10s of small changes a day and we have alerts. I bet we won't break production (without noticing)</blockquote>
    <p>#YOLO!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="fragment">
    <blockquote>Let's just do it in production with fake traffic at the same time as customers!</blockquote>
    <p>#WhatCouldPossiblyGoWrong?</p>
  </div>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>Customers are great load agents, and also generate far more chaos than our code does</p>
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Reasons why this isn't insane</h2>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>Tight feedback loops</p>
    <p>Engineers support what they ship... and so are <strong>highly</strong> invested in not regressing non-functionals.</p>
    <p>Teams are cross-functional and full-stack</p>
    <p>Engineers own their own code and operations thereof</p>
    <p>Platform has near real-time monitoring &amp; alerting</p>
    <p>Centralised logs for <q>why</q>-TF</p>
    <p>Engineers get paged while on call</p>
    <p>Engineers can turn off fake load easily</p>
    <p>Engineers can rollback quickly and easily</p>
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How did we start doing this?</h2>
  <p>Technology aspects and people aspects</p>
</section>

  <section>
    <h3>Have the idea to start</h3>
    <p><a href="http://eranki.tumblr.com/post/27076431887/scaling-lessons-learned-at-dropbox-part-1" target="_blank">We didn't invent this.</a></p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>DoE found it.</p>
      <p>CTO liked the idea</p>
      <p>Actually took most effort to get the engineers to buy into it, rather than management</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Choose scenarios we care about</h3>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p><q>Customer must be able to buy food</q></p>
      <p>Who has functional test coverage for these? Maybe reuse that to start with, but with data that is present in production.</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Choose a load agent</h3>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>We chose jmeter. It's free, has a reasonable UI, and is friendly toward automating (provisioning onto machines, running, reporting).</p>
      <p>Arbitrary choice. Could have used gatling, tsung, grinder, various commercial ones.</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Gain confidence outside of peak time</h3>
    <p>(This part is also about reassuring stakeholders that you've got it all under control...)</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Start early in the working day. Everyone's in the office</p>
      <p>Graduate to later, when real traffic starts</p>
      <p>Figure out what alert coverage around resource metrics is missing and add it &mdash; this is safety net level</p>
      <p>Aside:</p>
      <p>It's generally better to measure people, not computers.</p>
      <p>So raise the level of abstraction for your alerting - logins/registrations per sec, etc, rather than disk I/O / CPU</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Start adding data variety</h3>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Initially, one fake user can use one fake restaurant... a LOT. But not buy anything</p>
      <p>Later, tens of thousands of fake load users</p>
      <p>Later, they can pay by cash</p>
      <p>Later, lots more fake load restaurants</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Make the computer do it every day</h3>
    <div class="fragment">
      This is the most vital part!
      <img src="fake-load/teamcity-fake-load-project.png" />
    </div>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Keep yourself honest</p>
      <p>If you have problems, fix them, don't ignore them.</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Get more elaborate later</h3>
    <p>Fake away external dependencies</p>
    <code>x-traffic-flavour: fake</code>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Business model best when payment takes place via online</p>
      <p>Therefore, coverage for payment processing really important</p>
      <p>But our payment processors did not want to be load-tested...</p>
      <p>Redirect the payment request to a test harness, running in production</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>And even more elaborate...</h3>
    <p>Fake away more complicated things</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>... like restaurants</p>
      <p>They don't want to be given fake orders</p>
      <p>Redirect fake orders to box emulator rather than real box in restaurant</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

<section>
  <h2>How have we <em>kept</em> doing this?</h2>
  <p>... and what did we learn to do better</p>
</section>

  <section>
    <h3>Don't allow tests to be red (for long)</h3>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>We get failures</p>
      <p>We turn off fake load</p>
      <p>We <strong>fix the problem</strong></p>
      <p>We <strong>re-enable</strong> the tests</p>
      <p>Like any tests that fail, right?</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Need to tune levels over time</h3>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>We need to revisit the load that we add over time</p>
      <p>Otherwise the safety net diminishes over time</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Get smarter about data management</h3>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>We accrue test data in production data storage</p>
      <p>Back office tools needed to be changed to hide fake orders from non-technical staff</p>
      <p>We still haven't written data archiving tools - but when we do, we'll retain the option of deferring the work because we can simply delete all the orders marked "fake"</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Embrace the fact that things break</h3>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>... because you have bought yourself time to fix them!</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

<section>
  <h2>What battle scars did we get... lately?</h2>
  <p>All of these would have hurt <em>badly</em> if we hadn't had the ability to turn the pain off <strong>ourselves</strong></p>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>Slipped a bit in the run-up to Christmas 2015</p>
    <p>Large effort to make sure we were ready for expected load.</p>
    <p>We made lots of improvements!</p>
  </aside>
</section>

  <section>
    <h3>Find unbounded result sets before customers</h3>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>At no point did we delete fake orders</p>
      <p>10k users creating several orders a minute for a month == many orders</p>
      <p>When you add <q>get order history</q> feature later, you realise you can't ship without paging</p>
      <p>You now have a robust paging implementation you can put everywhere else</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Monitoring needs to be solid!</h3>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>More instances to process more load == more metrics being pushed to monitoring</p>
      <p>Exposes capacity of monitoring services - ahead of hitting it <q>for real</q></p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Realise AWS account limits are closer than we thought...</h3>
    <div class="fragment">
      <img src="fake-load/cloud-is-someone-elses-computer.png" />
      <p style="font-size: 40%; text-align: right">Credit: StickerMule.com</p>
    </div>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Scale up for Christmas would not have worked if we'd tried for real load</p>
      <p>Maxed out</p>
      <ul>
        <li>particular instance sizes</li>
        <li>DynamoDB throughput across our whole production account</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Because we did it in advance, it was a non-issue</p>
      <p>We now wrap automated alerts around account limits via AWS Trusted Advisor &amp; CloudWatch</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Realise haproxy should balance, not magnify load...</h3>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>We run multi-AZ within one region</p>
      <p>It was balancing all the load to one AZ rather than spreading across all 3 AZs</p>
      <p>So a load magnifier rather than balancer</p>
      <p>At predicted Christmas load levels, this blew away the session state mechanism that we had in place</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Realise we're not as smart as we think...</h3>
    <div class="fragment">
      <img src="fake-load/unique-usernames-oops.png" alt="embracing failure" />
    </div>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>One scenario created a user with the same email address each time</p>
      <p>Platform allows non-unique email addresses</p>
      <p>Didn't notice. 350k users created.</p>
      <p>SQL Server recompiled query plan to use table scan to log users in, instead of index, since 5% of users were... this user</p>
      <p>40 minutes of downtime before peak.</p>
      <p>Irony - having to leave a conference about operations early because of a problem in production</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>But...</h3>
    <p>Discovered problems during peacetime, not peak time</p>
  </section>


<section>
  <h2>What did we gain?</h2>

</section>

  <section>
    <h3>Peace of mind, #1</h3>
    <p>Continuous, early, warning about:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">Getting slower</li>
      <li class="fragment">Running out of capacity</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Basically, we want to aim for</p>
      <p>Get no worse without noticing</p>
      <p>Know on Thursday whether we're good for Saturday night</p>
      <p>Maintain acceptable head-room for projected 6 months of growth</p>
      <p>But we're in the cloud?  It's not <em>our</em> cloud...</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Peace of mind, #2</h3>
    <p>Good, simple, clear operational response to most surprises:</p>
    <blockquote class="fragment">
      <p>Is fake load running? Stop it.</p>
      <p>Scale up</p>
      <p>Now, start to think</p>
    </blockquote>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Great for dealing with unexpected spikes, like if a large competitor goes down</p>
      <p>Immediately, less stress on the platform</p>
      <p>Buy time to think</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Peace of mind, #3</h3>
    <p>If we find a problem Thursday night:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Turn off fake load for the weekend</li>
      <li>Enjoy weekend</li>
      <li>Fix it next week with less pressure</li>
    </ol>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Be respectful to the personal time of our engineers</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Performance &amp; operability == 1st class concern</h3>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>No engineer wants their personal time interrupted</p>
      <p>Ready for production != ready for customers</p>
      <p>Stimulates performance profiling &amp; telemetry being done/added before release</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Alerts become automated tests in production</h3>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Promote the idea of performance budgets</p>
      <p>Makes the <q>we need to do some optimisation work</q> conversation with product management data-driven &mdash; and therefore shorter</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3><code>git push production</code> is one step closer</h3>
    <p>Continuous testing in production can be applied to more than just performance &amp; capacity</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>We've now got extension points in platform to differentiate fake load from real load.</p>
      <p>Use this for one-level-deep integration testing via stubbing responses</p>
      <p>Decouple from depending on data setup/teardown, or presence within an environment</p>
      <p>This, combined with traffic-routing, means even fewer reasons to need separate pre-production environment</p>
      <p>This <em>also</em> also means on-boarding new people is faster, because first checkout to first commit is simpler</p>
