# Windows at Scale

Windows has a reputation for being harder than it needs to be to run at scale.

This isn't as true as it once was.

This talk is about how one Windows platform went from being deployed a few times a year, to hundreds a year. Falling over at 2 orders a minute, to laughing at 2k/min. Monitoring by remoting onto machines into perfmon, to automated alerts from a central authority. Chewing days of engineering time on debugging machines to keep them limping onward, to gleefully shooting machines in the head on stage knowing the fresh ones would come back inside 20 minutes.
